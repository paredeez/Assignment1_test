Hello! My name is Sam Paredes and I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology in my first year of University at RMIT. My student number is S3899867 and I am attending the City Campus. I am of South American and European descent but I am a born and raised Australian. I was born in Sydney Australia and moved to Melbourne in 2014 because of a job promotion for my father. My mother is from Paraguay in South America and my father is Argentinian and Spanish. This ultimately makes me a fluent spanish speaker. I’m bilingual and so are my 3 younger siblings. I’m a Christian and frequently attend Hillsong Church at least twice a month.


My education started in Haberfield Public School in Sydney from Prep until Year 5. When moving to Melbourne, I attended Mckinnon Primary College and finished my Primary Education there. For high school, I attended Mckinnon Secondary College and successfully completed my VCE studies with an 80+ ATAR. I was also awarded a VCE award for my excellence in Units 3&4 Data Analytics/Informatics. I duxxed my class and received a 40+ study score for it. 


My hobbies include, going out on the weekends with my mates and going to bars and clubs, bingeing TV shows and films, gaming and listening to and making music. Throughout quarantine I learnt how to use music producing software like Ableton and garageband and made a full album with beats made from scratch. Ever since then, I’ve tried to learn more and more and broaden my music producing knowledge. 


I’m very interested in Politics, Film

Interest In IT
I have been interested in technology and IT as a whole since I was in the 4th grade when I was given an award from my 4th grade teacher for my “Advanced IT skills”. I’ve always wanted to learn more and more about what Technology is and what is to come in the future from it. Technology is around us 24/7 as we are connected to it in some capacity everyday of our lives. I’m an avid social media user as I’m always reading up on global news and what's happening around the world on Twitter. Ever since I was a kid, I was glued to the computer screen and was fascinated by all you could do with the Internet and technology. Whether it was watching my favourite shows on Youtube or playing web games like Club Penguin and Poptropica,  I was always drawn to technology. 


In high school, I was in every IT class available starting from Year 7 IT onto Year 12 Software Development and Year 12 Data Analytics. The subject of IT was always a strength of mine as I excelled in them in comparison to other subjects like English and Maths. In year 10 I became familiar with how to use Photoshop and create websites using Dreamweaver and in year 11 I extended my knowledge by getting taught how to create programs using Visual Basic. Throughout my high school experience, I also got taught the basic fundamentals of applications such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access where I learnt how to store large quantities of data in a database for later manipulation such as making queries and reports. This is where I knew that I wanted to have a career in the IT field. The problem solving nature of creating programs using Visual Basic gave me the love and determination of IT and made me want to broaden my knowledge, thus I enrolled into RMIT and chose to pursue a Bachelor of Information Technology. 


I chose to come to RMIT as I’ve heard from friends that are currently studying at RMIT that it has a great IT reputation and is known for its academic excellence within the IT field. The facilities that RMIT has to offer also gravitated me towards choosing it as my first preference. The location of the campus also attracted me as I love being within the city environment and surrounded by the amazing food culture and atmosphere that the Melbourne CBD has to offer.
